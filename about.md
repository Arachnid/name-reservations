This site documents preregistration requests for the ENS .eth short name pre-registration process.

Anyone with a DNS domain may request reservation of the corresponding .eth domain in ENS. Requests must meet the following criteria:

 1. The domain the request is based on must have been registered prior to January 1, 2019.
 2. The name being requested must be between 3 and 6 characters long.
 3. The name being requested must either exactly match the DNS domain (foo.com -> foo.eth), be the DNS domain with the suffix 'eth' removed (asseth.fr -> ass.eth), or be the concatenation of the DNS domain and TLD (foo.bar -> foobar.eth).

In the event that multiple claims are made for the same short name, conflicts will be resolved in favor of the DNS name that has been registered for the longest, based on available Whois data.

For instructions on how to submit a preregistration request, see [the howto page](../howto/).
